# PETG Pneumatic Tube System

Premium PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) transparent tubes engineered for pneumatic transport systems. Our tubes deliver exceptional clarity, durability, and air-tight performance for demanding logistics applications.

## Key Features

- **Crystal Clear Transparency**: Visual monitoring of carrier movement
- **Silent Operation**: Smooth interior reduces noise during transport
- **Leak-Proof Joints**: Precision-machined connections ensure air-tight seals
- **Impact Resistant**: PETG material withstands carrier collisions
- **Chemical Resistant**: Safe for pharmaceutical environments
