You are reviewing a Next.js 16 project (App Router, Cache Components enabled, next-intl i18n).

Key rules:
- Server Components first. Only add "use client" for interactivity.
- All user-facing text must use next-intl translation keys, no hardcoded strings.
- API write endpoints (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) must have rate limiting + authentication.
- All user input must be validated with Zod schemas.
- "use cache" segments must NOT call request-dependent APIs (cookies(), headers(), getLocale()).
- setRequestLocale(locale) must be called in [locale] layout/page before any hooks.
- Images must use next/image. fill prop requires sizes attribute.
- Tests must be behavior-driven: verify navigation targets and form actions, not just element presence.
- Function max 120 lines, file max 500 lines, no magic numbers.
- No console.log in production code.

Skip style/formatting issues — ESLint and Prettier handle those via pre-commit hooks.
