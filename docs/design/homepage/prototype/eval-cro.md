## Per-Prototype Analysis

### v1 "Navy+Amber"

**Overall: 46/70 -- Solid foundation, but the hero undersells the differentiation.**

**Above-fold impact (6/10)**: The hero has a split-panel layout with text left, image placeholders right. The headline "PVC Conduit Bends. Machine Makers. Pipe Experts." communicates the positioning in three punchy fragments, but the line break structure feels like it's listing features rather than making a bold claim. The single hero CTA says "See How We Build" -- this scrolls to the tech section instead of driving toward an inquiry action. A buyer who lands here gets orientation but not urgency. The amber color on navy is distinctive but the overall first impression is "serious catalog" rather than "this is the factory that builds the machines."

**CTA visibility & hierarchy (5/10)**: This is v1's weakest area. The primary hero CTA ("See How We Build") is an amber button, but it's a content navigation CTA, not a conversion CTA. The first actual conversion action (Request Free Samples) doesn't appear until Section 4, roughly 3 screens down. The final CTA section has "Get Factory-Direct Quote" and "Book Technical Consultation" but these are buried at the very bottom. There is no persistent header or sticky CTA. A buyer scanning quickly could leave without ever seeing a quote button.

**Trust signal placement (7/10)**: Social proof appears directly in the hero ("Exporting to 20+ countries", "ISO 9001:2015 Certified") with small icons. Scenario testimonials are well-placed within each application card, creating contextual trust. Certifications get their own section (Section 7) with badge-style display. The logo wall placeholders are present. The trust line in the final CTA repeats key credibility points. Good structural placement, but the hero social proof is too understated -- small gray text.

**AIDA flow (7/10)**: The 8-section AIDA structure (Hero > Tech Chain > Products > Sample CTA > Scenarios > Commitments > Certs > Final CTA) is clean and logical. The flow from "who we are" to "what we make" to "where it's used" to "why trust us" to "take action" makes sense. However, the transition from Hero directly to Tech is unusual -- most B2B buyers want to see products first, not manufacturing process. The process section, while differentiating, may lose impatient buyers.

**Information scent (7/10)**: Product cards show specs (angles, schedules, standards), size ranges (16-168mm) are stated upfront, and each card has "View Specifications" links. Application scenarios give buyers contextual cues for their use case. However, there's no pricing signal, no MOQ indication except on the Custom/OEM card ("Low MOQ" tag), and no lead time information visible.

**Friction reduction (7/10)**: The free sample CTA is strong ("Test Before You Commit" with "Ships within 3 days, you only pay freight"). This is excellent low-commitment entry. However, it's visually muted -- amber background with navy text doesn't pop as much as it should for such a powerful offer. The final CTA offers both "Get Factory-Direct Quote" and "Book Technical Consultation" -- two paths, which is good.

**B2B buyer psychology (7/10)**: Addresses tolerances (plus/minus 0.3mm), mentions standard compliance (ASTM, UL651, AS/NZS), shows batch traceability and export-ready packaging -- all things procurement managers care about. The vertical integration story (5 steps, all in-house) is compelling for price-conscious buyers. However, the "commitments" section with "48-hour drawings" and "Flexible MOQ" could be stronger if it included specific numbers rather than vague promises.

#### Standout elements

- **Free Sample CTA copy**: "Test Before You Commit. Verify the quality yourself. Ships within 3 days -- you only pay freight." This is the single best piece of conversion copy across all sections in v1. It addresses the trust gap in B2B manufacturing perfectly.
- **Product specs as bullet lists**: Clean, scannable, with amber dot markers. Buyers can quickly check if the specs match their needs.
- **Scenario testimonials**: Pairing each application with a specific customer quote (with title and location) creates believable social proof. The testimonials feel real because they're specific ("Saved us 2 days on site", "Zero leaks in 18 months").

### v2 "Twitter Blue"

**Overall: 46/70 -- Too consumer-friendly for an industrial buyer audience.**

**Above-fold impact (6/10)**: Nearly identical content structure to v1 -- same headline, same badge, same CTA. The visual treatment uses rounded corners (full pill shapes for buttons, large border-radius cards), blue accent color, and Outfit font. This feels like a SaaS product or social media platform, not a manufacturing company. B2B industrial buyers may subconsciously distrust it -- it looks like a marketing site, not a factory website. The blue accent on "Machine Makers" is nice but the overall tone is too polished/consumer-oriented for the audience.

**CTA visibility & hierarchy (6/10)**: Same structural problem as v1 -- the hero CTA is "See How We Build" (navigation, not conversion). However, the blue pill-shaped button is slightly more visually prominent due to the rounded shape and hover glow effect (`box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(29, 155, 240, 0.3)`). The sample section uses a white button on blue background, which pops more than v1's version. Still no sticky/persistent CTA.

**Trust signal placement (7/10)**: Same structural placement as v1. The blue tinting on trust badges is clean but slightly less "credible" for industrial context. The cert badges use pill shapes (rounded full), which looks more consumer-oriented. Section dividers use subtle gradient lines -- visually clean but adds no conversion value.

**AIDA flow (7/10)**: Identical section structure to v1. The section-line dividers between major sections are a nice pacing device. The visual consistency of the blue system makes the flow feel smooth. Same issue though: tech before products may lose impatient buyers.

**Information scent (7/10)**: Same content as v1, rendered in a more readable way due to stronger typographic hierarchy (Outfit is a wider, more readable display face than IBM Plex Sans). Product tags use pill shapes which are more scannable. But same content gaps: no pricing signals, limited MOQ info.

**Friction reduction (7/10)**: Same copy as v1. The blue treatment of the sample section is warmer and more inviting than v1's amber. The "Request Free Samples" button in white on blue background has good contrast and visibility.

**B2B buyer psychology (6/10)**: This is where v2 loses ground. The visual language -- rounded corners everywhere, blue accent color, Outfit font, subtle hover animations with card lifts -- all signal "consumer tech product" or "startup SaaS." Industrial buyers are conditioned to trust sites that look functional and technical, not pretty. The pill-shaped cert badges make ISO and UL certifications look like tags on a blog post rather than serious quality credentials. A procurement manager from a utility company would find this feel disconnected from the industry.

#### Standout elements

- **Typography**: Outfit at 800 weight is extremely readable for headlines. The typographic hierarchy is the clearest across all prototypes for quick scanning.
- **Process timeline connecting line**: The gradient line behind the process steps (with blue center fading to gray at edges) is the best visualization of the manufacturing chain across all prototypes. It communicates progression and integration.
- **Card hover states**: The translateY(-2px) lift on product and scenario cards gives clear interactive feedback. Subtle but effective for indicating clickability.

---

### v3 "The Forge"

**Overall: 51/70 -- The strongest brand identity and the most memorable first impression, but the aggressive visual tone creates friction for some buyer segments.**

**Above-fold impact (8/10)**: This is the clear winner for first impression. The Archivo Black display font at clamp(42px, 6vw, 72px) creates a massive, imposing headline. The full-width layout (headline spans full container, then grid below for text + images) gives the page a magazine-editorial feel that screams "manufacturer." The thin red brand bar at the top is a small but effective branding detail. The monochrome palette with single red accent says "we are serious about what we do." The diagonal texture background is subtle but adds depth. This hero would make a procurement manager stop scrolling.

**CTA visibility & hierarchy (7/10)**: The "See How We Build" button is now in red (ember), which is more urgent than amber or blue. The uppercase text on buttons, combined with zero border-radius, communicates factory precision. However, the same structural flaw exists: no primary conversion CTA in the hero. The red accent on the product card hover (bottom border that animates from 0 to 100% width) is an excellent micro-interaction that guides attention. The sample section CTA is also red, maintaining hierarchy.

**Trust signal placement (7/10)**: The monochrome social proof items in the hero feel industrial-authentic (mono font, small size, shield icon in graphite). The cert section is redesigned as a horizontal split (text left, badge row right) which is more space-efficient. The logo wall is pushed into its own mini-section below certs. This is pragmatic but may reduce the combined impact of certs + client logos together.

**AIDA flow (8/10)**: Best AIDA execution among the HTML prototypes. The "ruler" dividers between sections create a blueprint/technical-drawing aesthetic that reinforces the manufacturing theme. The section numbering ([02] next to headers) adds a systematic feel. The tech copy uses an "accent-left" red bar on the left border, which draws the eye to the key differentiator line about plus/minus 0.3mm tolerances. The transition from dark-themed sections to light ones creates rhythm and visual pacing.

**Information scent (7/10)**: Product card numbering uses bracket notation ([01], [02]) which feels like a catalog part number system -- industrial buyers will recognize this pattern. Spec lists use horizontal line markers (6px wide, 1px tall red dashes) instead of dots, which is distinctive. Same content gaps as v1/v2 on pricing and lead times.

**Friction reduction (6/10)**: The aggressive visual tone (uppercase buttons, zero border radius, monochrome palette, red accents) creates a "take it or leave it" personality that could alienate smaller or first-time buyers. The sample section is styled with borders top and bottom, text laid out horizontally with heading and description side by side -- more efficient but feels less inviting than v1/v2's centered/highlighted treatment. The red "REQUEST FREE SAMPLES" uppercase button feels more like a command than an invitation.

**B2B buyer psychology (8/10)**: This is v3's second-strongest area after above-fold impact. The entire visual language communicates manufacturing competence: zero border-radius (precision cuts), monochrome palette (steel/industrial), Archivo Black display font (heavy machinery), red accent (forging, heat, industrial marking). The ruler dividers reference technical drawings. The bracket numbering references part catalogs. Every visual choice reinforces the brand narrative: "We are manufacturers, not marketers." This is exactly what industrial buyers respond to -- the site should look like it was built by engineers, not designers.

#### Standout elements

- **Brand bar**: The 3px fixed red bar at the top of the page is the most distinctive brand element across all prototypes. It's like a laser alignment guide on a machine -- minimal, precise, always present.
- **Ruler dividers**: The ruler-style section dividers with measurement marks at the container edges are brilliant. They turn what would be boring horizontal lines into a visual metaphor for precision manufacturing.
- **Product card hover animation**: The bottom-border red line that grows from 0 to 100% width on hover is the best micro-interaction across all prototypes. It communicates "precision" and "progress" in a single animation.
- **Tech copy accent-left treatment**: The red left-border on the tolerance statement draws the eye directly to the most important differentiator. Better than centering it (v1/v2).

### Stitch A "Clean Precision"

**Overall: 53/70 -- The highest-scoring prototype. Best balance of trust, clarity, and conversion-oriented design.**

**Above-fold impact (7/10)**: The hero uses a white/light background with strong blue accent. The headline layout is similar to the HTML prototypes but with a key difference: the hero image area appears to show an actual bending machine image (or realistic representation) rather than placeholders. The navigation bar is clean with clear product/technology/scenarios/certifications/contact links. There's a visible "Get a Quote" button in the header, which is a critical difference from all HTML prototypes. The blue accent badge "EXPORTING TO 20+ COUNTRIES" at the top provides immediate international credibility. The layout feels professional and clean without being overly designed. Two hero CTAs are visible: "View Factory" and "Our Factory" -- providing both information-seeking and action-oriented paths. However, the headline could be bolder -- it doesn't have the typographic punch of v3.

**CTA visibility & hierarchy (8/10)**: This is Stitch A's strongest conversion element. There is a persistent "Get a Quote" button in the navigation header -- this means conversion is always one click away regardless of scroll position. The hero has dual CTAs. The tech section shows key stats (0.05mm tolerance, 24/7 production) prominently with large numbers. The sample section ("Test Before You Commit") is prominently blue with a large "Request Free Samples" button. The final CTA section uses dual buttons. The CTA hierarchy is clear: quote (always available) > free samples (mid-page) > final quote + consultation (bottom). This is the best CTA architecture across all 5 prototypes.

**Trust signal placement (8/10)**: Certifications appear in the footer area alongside the final CTA. The navigation includes a "Certifications" link for direct access. The product section shows actual product images (appears to use real photography or realistic renders of PVC conduit bends, bell ends, flared fittings). The application scenarios section shows what appears to be real construction/installation photography. Social proof stats are integrated into the tech section with large, readable numbers. The logo wall appears at the bottom. Trust is woven throughout rather than isolated in one section.

**AIDA flow (7/10)**: The section flow is: Hero > Tech Stats > Process Steps > Products > Sample CTA > Applications > Service Commitments > Certs/Final CTA. The tech stats appearing before the process steps is a smart change -- buyers see the impressive numbers (0.05mm, 24/7) before they see how those numbers are achieved. Products come next (addressing "what can you make for me"), then the sample offer (reducing risk), then applications (peer validation), then commitments and certs (final trust layer), then CTA. The only weakness: the process step section uses only 4 steps instead of 5, which may omit the QC step that industrial buyers specifically look for.

**Information scent (8/10)**: Product cards appear to show actual product images with clear labels ("Standard Bends", "Bell End Fittings", "Flared Fittings", "Custom Projects"). Each card has a "View Specs" or "Start Project" link. The tech section prominently displays tolerance (0.05mm) and production schedule (24/7) -- the two things buyers check first. The application scenarios show 3 key environments with real photography. The visual density of information is high but well-organized.

**Friction reduction (8/10)**: The persistent header CTA means a buyer can convert at any moment -- this is the single biggest friction reducer. The free sample section is prominent and clearly worded. The dual CTA approach (quote vs. consultation) at the bottom gives buyers a choice based on their decision stage. The overall visual feel is approachable and professional without being pushy.

**B2B buyer psychology (7/10)**: The clean, professional aesthetic is appropriate for B2B but lacks some of the industrial gravitas that v3 achieves. The product photography (real images of conduit bends and fittings) is extremely important for this audience -- buyers want to see actual products, not placeholders. The stat callouts (0.05mm, 24/7) speak directly to operational concerns. The application photos show real construction environments which helps buyers visualize the product in their context. However, the overall design could lean more into the "manufacturer" identity -- it currently looks like it could be any professional supplier, not specifically a factory that builds bending machines.

#### Standout elements

- **Persistent header CTA**: The "Get a Quote" button always visible in the navigation is the single most important CRO feature across all 5 prototypes. This alone likely accounts for a significant conversion lift.
- **Real product photography**: The product section appears to use actual photos of PVC conduit products. For industrial B2B, this is critical -- buyers need to visually verify they're looking at the right product category and quality level.
- **Stat callouts in tech section**: Large, prominent display of 0.05mm tolerance and 24/7 production. These numbers tell a buyer everything they need to know about capability in 2 seconds.
- **Application scenario photography**: Real construction/installation images create immediate recognition for contractors and project managers.

### Stitch B "Dark Forge"

**Overall: 47/70 -- Strong visual impact and brand recall, but the dark theme creates readability and trust issues for B2B conversion.**

**Above-fold impact (8/10)**: The dark theme with red accents creates an immediately striking visual. The header shows the Tianze brand in red on black. The hero appears to use a dramatic product/machinery photograph against a dark background. The headline is large and uses what appears to be a bold weight with red italic accent on "Machine Makers." The overall feel is "premium industrial" -- like a heavy equipment manufacturer's hero section. Two hero CTAs are visible in red and outlined styles. The dark theme instantly differentiates from every other PVC conduit manufacturer's website (which are typically white/light blue). This could be either a massive advantage or a risk.

**CTA visibility & hierarchy (7/10)**: The header appears to have a "Get a Quote" button (red on dark background) for persistent conversion access. Hero dual CTAs are present. The sample section uses a striking red/dark banner with a "Request Free Samples" button. The final CTA section is dark-on-darker with large text. Red CTAs on dark backgrounds have strong contrast. However, secondary CTAs (outlined in light on dark) may be harder to see. The overall dark theme can make some interactive elements less discoverable.

**Trust signal placement (6/10)**: This is Stitch B's weakness. Dark themes inherently reduce perceived trustworthiness in B2B contexts -- buyers associate dark themes with entertainment, gaming, or premium consumer products, not manufacturing reliability. The certifications section appears at the bottom with smaller badges. The application scenarios section uses dark card backgrounds which can make the imagery harder to read. The service commitment icons appear small against the dark background. While the content is there, the dark canvas makes trust signals work harder to be noticed and believed.

**AIDA flow (7/10)**: The section structure appears to follow: Hero > Tech/Process > Products > Sample CTA > Applications > Commitments/Certs > Final CTA. The dark background creates strong visual separation between the light-highlighted elements. The application section uses a grid with what appears to be 6 scenario cards with overhead photography of industrial environments. The flow is logical but the uniform dark palette can make sections blur together as the user scrolls.

**Information scent (6/10)**: The dark theme reduces the readability of detailed spec information. Product cards appear against dark backgrounds with lighter text -- this inverts the typical reading pattern and may slow down spec scanning. The product images appear as grayscale or muted against dark backgrounds. For a buyer trying to quickly scan 4 product lines and compare specs, the dark theme adds cognitive load.

**Friction reduction (6/10)**: The aggressive dark aesthetic may signal "premium/exclusive" which could paradoxically increase friction for some buyers ("is this company too high-end for my order size?"). The uppercase, bold treatment of CTAs is commanding but could feel pushy. The dark theme makes the overall experience feel more like a "showroom" than a "supplier catalog" -- some buyers want a catalog feel. The free sample section compensates somewhat with its visible red treatment.

**B2B buyer psychology (7/10)**: The dark forge aesthetic powerfully communicates manufacturing identity -- this feels like a factory at night, metal being shaped in heat. For technically-oriented buyers (engineers, project managers who've walked factory floors), this visual language resonates. The red accent is industrial (think machine warning lights, forge heat). However, for procurement managers who spend their days in spreadsheets and ERPs, this design may feel alienating. The category of "PVC conduit fittings" -- fundamentally a commodity product -- may not warrant this level of dramatic presentation. There's a risk of the design overselling the product category.

#### Standout elements

- **Brand differentiation**: No other PVC conduit manufacturer website uses a dark theme. This would be instantly memorable in a buyer's browser tab lineup when comparing 5-10 suppliers.
- **Hero imagery**: The dramatic product/machinery photography against dark backgrounds creates a premium, capability-focused first impression.
- **Application scenario grid**: The 6-card grid with what appears to be overhead/architectural photography of industrial environments (data centers, infrastructure, commercial buildings) is visually compelling and helps buyers self-select their use case.
- **Emotional impact**: This design creates the strongest emotional response of all 5 prototypes. In B2B, where most supplier sites look interchangeable, emotional differentiation has real value.

## Overall CRO Ranking

### 1. Stitch A "Clean Precision" -- 53/70

**The winner, but not by a landslide.** Stitch A wins because it gets the fundamentals right: persistent CTA in header, real product photography, clean information hierarchy, prominent stat callouts, and a professional tone that doesn't alienate any buyer segment. It lacks the brand personality of v3 and the visual drama of Stitch B, but in B2B conversion, clarity and accessibility beat memorability. The persistent header CTA alone would likely produce measurably higher conversion than any other prototype.

### 2. v3 "The Forge" -- 51/70

**The strongest brand play, and the most likely to be remembered.** If brand differentiation is weighted equally with pure conversion, v3 could arguably be #1. The Archivo Black headlines, ruler dividers, bracket numbering, and monochrome+red palette create a brand identity that no competitor could replicate. However, the aggressive visual tone introduces friction for less technical buyer segments, and the lack of a persistent CTA is a real conversion liability.

### 3. Stitch B "Dark Forge" -- 47/70

**Memorable but risky.** The dark theme makes this the most visually distinctive option and it would stand out in any supplier comparison. But dark themes reduce readability, lower perceived trustworthiness for B2B, and add cognitive load for spec scanning. Best reserved for a premium sub-brand or campaign landing page, not the primary homepage.

### 4. v1 "Navy+Amber" / v2 "Twitter Blue" (tied) -- 46/70

**Both are competent but unexceptional.** They follow the same content structure with different visual treatments. v1 is more appropriate for the industrial audience (navy is serious, amber is warm-industrial). v2 is too consumer/SaaS-oriented for this market. Neither has a persistent CTA, and neither creates a memorable brand impression. They are solid starting points but need significant CRO enhancements.

---

## Recommended Cherry-Picks

The optimal conversion page should combine these elements:

### From Stitch A:
- **Persistent "Get a Quote" header CTA** -- non-negotiable, highest-impact single change
- **Real product photography** in product cards and application scenarios
- **Large stat callouts** (tolerance, production hours) in the tech section
- **Clean white background** as the base visual foundation

### From v3 "The Forge":
- **Hero headline typography** -- use a bold display face (not necessarily Archivo Black, but something with weight and presence) for the main hero text
- **Ruler-style section dividers** -- subtle but reinforces manufacturing identity
- **Product card bottom-border hover animation** -- the red line growing from left to right on hover
- **Accent-left treatment** on the key differentiator copy (tolerance statement)
- **Bracket numbering system** for product cards ([01], [02], etc.)
- **Zero border-radius** on buttons and cards -- signals precision, not softness
- **Brand bar** -- the thin red/accent line at page top

### From v1/v2 (shared content):
- **Free sample section copy** -- "Test Before You Commit" headline and "Ships within 3 days, you only pay freight" supporting text
- **Scenario-embedded testimonials** -- keep customer quotes inside each application scenario card, with specific roles and locations

### From v2 "Twitter Blue":
- **Process timeline connecting gradient line** -- best visualization of the manufacturing chain flow

### From Stitch B "Dark Forge":
- **Dark theme for the final CTA section only** -- use it as a visual shift at the end to create contrast and urgency, not for the whole page
- **Application scenario grid layout** -- the 6-card grid with overhead photography

### What NO prototype does well enough (gaps to fill):
1. **Pricing signals** -- Add indicative pricing or at minimum "Volume pricing available" messaging
2. **Lead time information** -- "Ships within X weeks" should be visible, not hidden behind a quote form
3. **MOQ transparency** -- Beyond just a "Low MOQ" tag, state actual minimum quantities
4. **WhatsApp/WeChat quick contact** -- For overseas B2B, messaging apps are faster than email. Add a floating chat widget.
5. **Video** -- None of the prototypes incorporate video. A 30-second factory tour auto-playing (muted) in the hero would dramatically increase engagement.
6. **Comparison table** -- A simple "Why Tianze vs. alternatives" comparison (factory direct vs. trading company vs. local brand) would accelerate the decision.
7. **Spec download** -- A visible "Download Catalog PDF" button for buyers who need to share specs internally with their engineering team.

### Recommended visual identity for the final page:

**Base**: Stitch A's clean, light, professional layout
**Accent system**: v3's precision language -- zero radius on interactive elements, monochrome + single warm accent (amber or controlled red), mono font for specs/data
**Hero**: v3's display font scale with Stitch A's real photography
**CTA color**: Not blue (too SaaS), not red (too aggressive for primary CTA). Amber/warm orange is the sweet spot -- it's industrial, warm, and visible on both light and dark backgrounds.

The result would be: **a site that looks like it was built by engineers who care about precision, not by a marketing agency that cares about trends.**
