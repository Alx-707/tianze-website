## Instructions

This project uses `CLAUDE.md` as the canonical instruction file.

**Before any task, you MUST read:**

1. `CLAUDE.md` — Project rules, stack, constraints
2. `.claude/rules/` — Detailed guidelines (read files relevant to your task)

These files contain critical project-specific decisions that override your training data.

## Quick Reference

- Stack: Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript 5 + Tailwind 4
- i18n: next-intl (all text via translation keys)
- Components: shadcn/ui based
